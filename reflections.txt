# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
I spent about 2 hours working on the project.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
I have a better understanding of requiring files when building a ruby application.
I also have a better understanding of separating concerns with modules, classes, and mixins.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
I added the abilitiy to set the progress of a feature.
I also added the progress percent to display in the console.
I used the progress_bar ruby gem to implement the feature of showing progress
percentage completed for a todo item.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I need practice working with ruby gems. It'd be great to learn about gems that
would be helpful for developing web applications, like rails. I'd also like to
learn more about testing in Ruby, and I'd like to learn how to work with FactoryGirl.
